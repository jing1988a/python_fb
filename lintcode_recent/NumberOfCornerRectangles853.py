# Description
# Given a grid where each entry is only 0 or 1, find the number of corner rectangles.
#
# A corner rectangle is 4 distinct 1s on the grid that form an axis-aligned rectangle. Note that only the corners need to have the value 1. Also, all four 1s used must be distinct.
#
# 1.The number of rows and columns of grid will each be in the range [1, 200].
# 2.Each grid[i][j] will be either 0 or 1.
# 3.The number of 1s in the grid will be at most 6000.

# Example
# Example 1:
#
# Given: grid =
# [[1, 0, 0, 1, 0],
#  [0, 0, 1, 0, 1],
#  [0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
#  [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]]
# Return: 1
# Explanation: There is only one corner rectangle, with corners grid[1][2], grid[1][4], grid[3][2], grid[3][4].
# Example 2:
#
# Given: grid =
# [[1, 1, 1],
#  [1, 1, 1],
#  [1, 1, 1]]
# Return: 9
# Explanation: There are four 2x2 rectangles, four 2x3 and 3x2 rectangles, and one 3x3 rectangle.
# Example 3:
#
# Given: grid =
# [[1, 1, 1, 1]]
# Return: 0
# Explanation: Rectangles must have four distinct corners.
